    reqs
    1. Ask name and input of users
    2. ask for the temperature in celcius and convert to farenheit
    2a. km to miles
    2b. pounds to kilograms
    2c. dollar amount and convert to euros
    3. Create a vector of 4 float numbers
    4. ask the user to store 5 integers and store them in a vector 
    print sum / average / largest / smallest
    also ask user to enter a number and check if it's in vector and print if it exists
